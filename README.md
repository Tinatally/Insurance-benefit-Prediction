# Insurance-benefit-Prediction
About the project: The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning, and you are asked to evaluate that possibility.
Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.
Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a prediction model do better than a dummy model?
Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.
Task 4: Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task. 
You don't need to pick the best model, just prove that the algorithm works correctly.

Summary Results: We demonstrated that it is possible to build models that meet Sure Tomorrow's requirements; this includes clustering observations, predicting whether an individual is likely to receive insurance benefits and, if so, how many, and obfuscating data. We believe that Sure Tomorrow could use versions of the models tested in the project to increase revenue through targeted advertisement and selective policy pricing.
